# Dotfiles

My NixOS dotfiles for both system and users (home-manager).

## Follow Along

Follow along with my NixOS evolution and things I learn along the way: [NixOS Desktop Series](https://jdisaacs.com/series/nixos-desktop/)

## Credit

Based on Wil Taylor's [dotfiles](https://github.com/wiltaylor/dotfiles). Would not have the setup I have today without his [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKoQ1gKJY5A&list=PL-saUBvIJzOkjAw_vOac75v-x6EzNzZq-) and repo as a guide.

## Custom Flakes

Using my custom [neovim-flake](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/neovim-flake), [dwm-flake](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/dwm-flake/), and [st-flake](https://github.com/jordanisaacs/st-flake).
